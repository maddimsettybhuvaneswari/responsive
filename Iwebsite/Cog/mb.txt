 task-3___note:
I commented a bockground style in inline css why because of , when I give a 
different colours style in media queries , it doesn't take total body , so I gave a 
baground color in external css file.

Register form
I used a icons in register form i.e., correct Icons{check_circle} and Wrong icons{Error}, 
these icons are taken in Google fonts When we used these icons we have internet to

task-7___note:
Bootstrap
I didn't download a bootstrap, I used the code in online like I attach a css links and 
Java script links and use the code in google, we have internet to acces it.
I used a bootstrap version 4.
when we apply css framework bootstrap it have thousand line of codes it have all html
styles tags so these styles are applied to all the elements as we mention in the index.html
file, so I customised a some styles in my own css files style.css and add some styles 
to html file.
